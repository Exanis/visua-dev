Dev tooling for Visua

## What is this ?

Visua is a simple tool aiming to non-programmers to let them process and manage vast amount of data. It is splitted in three parts: a runner, an API and a frontend. This project is a set of tooling (mostly skaffold / kubernetes configuration) used to help testing / deploying it. Documentation, as well as backlog and bug reporting, can be found in the main project [here](https://github.com/Exanis/visua)
